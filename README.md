# SwadeshNess
[Project for Swadesh-like lists creation](https://github.com/aeternas/SwadeshNess) (more information about Swadesh lists on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list?oldformat=true)) being refactored in Spring Boot 2 and new Yandex translation tool.

Still no stable version, WIP now. Stay tuned or run unit test if you want.
